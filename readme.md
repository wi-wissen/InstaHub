## InstaHub

**Source code and install instructions are in English. Documentation and excersices currently are available in German only.**

InstaHub is a social network for educational purpose only. Students can create their own social network as a database admin. They learn basics about working in a software project, creating and managing a database, querying (SQL SELECT) and editing (SQL INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE).

This project aims to help students develop a general technical understanding of social networks. As result, they will be able to discuss sinjects as big data and information privacy.

### Prerequisits for Sail

```
docker-compose exec mariadb bash
mysql -u root -p
# default: password
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'sail'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

#### Mac Os, Ubuntu and Windows

1. Create a local database named `instahub`  with encoding utf8_general_ci 
2. Create user `instahub` and grant all rights on `instahub` and for creating databases
3. cd to your local target folder and clone remote project: `git clone git://github.com/wi-wissen/instahub.git`
4. Rename `.env.example` file to `.env`inside your project root and fill in the database information.
  (windows won't let you do that, so you have to use Notepad++ or open your console, cd your project root directory and run `mv .env.example .env` )
5. Edit `.env`
    - `APP_ENV=production` (In `test` Teacher will be activated automatically.)
    - `APP_DEBUG=false` - enable only temporaly for debugging!
    - `DB_*` - if you want another database than MySQL, you have to edit source code.
    - `DB_USERNAME` - user for database
    - `DB_PASSWORD` - passwort for database
    - `MAIL_*` - mail provider for notification of new teachers and resetting passworts (admin accounts may reset passworts without sending a mail)
6. Open the console and cd to your project root directory
7. Run `composer install` or ```php composer.phar install``` ([Howto install composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/))
Optional: Just to be safe or if an error occur on bootup run `php artisan config:clear`
8.  You may need to configure some permissions. Directories within the `storage` and the `bootstrap/cache` directories should be writable by your web server
9. Run `php artisan storage:link`
10. Run `php artisan key:generate` 
11. Run `php artisan migrate`
12. Run `php artisan migrate --path=/database/migrations/create/users`
13. Configure your top-level domain and all subdomains (wildcard) to point to the `public` directory 
14. Visit website and create first teacher (ignore error after creating, thats okay cause you are the first).
15. In the `user` table of your database, manually set the attribute  `is_active` to `1` and `role` to `admin`. Now your user is admin and may manage other accounts.

I recomend to add a cronjob to your system: `* * * * * php /path/to/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1`
Then InstaHub will delete old analytic database files each night.

### Update

1. `php artisan migrate`
2. `php artisan migrate:hubs`
